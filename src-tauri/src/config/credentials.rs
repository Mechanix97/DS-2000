//! Storage for the user's Discord credentials.
//!
//! DS-2000 ships no Discord credentials of its own. Discord restricts the `rpc` scope to an
//! application's owner plus a 50-slot tester list, and general approval is closed, so a single
//! shared application would cap the app at 50 users. Instead each user registers their own
//! Discord application and supplies its credentials — as the owner of that application they can
//! always authorise the scope.
//!
//! The client id is not secret (it is shown in Discord's own authorisation modal) and lives in
//! the plain config file. The client secret and the OAuth tokens are kept in the operating
//! system keyring, never on disk in the clear and never in the binary.
